# IA
Laboratories and homeworks for the Artificial Intelligence course.

# Homework1 - Timetable Problem
Implementation of Monte Carlo and Hill Climbing Algorithms used for solving the timetable problem.

# Homework2 - Classifications
Implementation for the MLP and Random Forrest algorithms, using sklearn and manual implementations for both of them. The given datasets are visualized(displaying statistics about their features) and preprocessed(using imputation and scaling methods) before applying the algorithms.

# Lab0 - Python Intro
An introduction to Python, with certain basic problems to solve.

# Lab1 - A*
Implementation for the A* algorithm using the euclidean and manhattan distances as heuristics. The implemented algorithm is used to solve a labyrinth and an 8-puzzle like game with the photo of Mihai Eminescu.

# Lab2 - Hill Climbing
Implementations for various hill climbing algorithms used to solve the 8 queens problem. For each algorithm is made a comparison at the end to conclude which one is better depending on the situation.

# Lab3 - PCSP
Implementation for the Partial Constraints Satisfaction Problem, used to solve various problems like: 8 queens problem, map coloring problem, solving a math equation, etc...

# Lab4 - MCTS
Implementation for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for playing a Connect 4 game with two players.

# Lab6 - Variables elimination in Bayessian Networks
Implementation for the Variables Elimination algorithm using probability factors and operations on these.

# Lab7 - Decision Trees
Implementation of a Decision Tree used to categorize data and actions from various datasets(tenis dataset to see if the weather is good for a game, car dataset for buying a car depending on its characteristics, etc...).

# Lab8 - Linear Regression
Implementation of Linear Regression used for data prediction. The model used to fit the data is computed directly, using the pseudoinverse matrix of the feature dataset and regularization for avoiding overfitting.

# Lab9 - Logistic Regression
Implementation of a binary classifier using Logistic Regression. The model classifies the data through the Negative Log Likelihood function which is minimized using the Gradient Descent algorithm.

# Lab10 - Neural Networks
Implementation of the MLP algorithm using the ReLU activation function for classifying images from the MNIST dataset.

# Lab11 - Naive Bayes
Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier used for text processing and analysis of human feelings.
